# Cornell-Birdcall-Identification
We Identified a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings. Due to the complexity of the recordings, they contain weak labels. There might be anthropogenic sounds (e.g., airplane overflights) or other bird and non-bird (e.g., chipmunk) calls in the background, with a particular labeled bird species in the foreground.

This work is done by Ratan Rohith, Urvish Patel, Phu Hien Nguyen and Mizanur Rahman.Public kerenls are used as a baseline from this competition.
